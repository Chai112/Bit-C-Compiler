## About
This is a personal project of mine to...
1. learn how compilers work, writing low level languages, CPU architecture.
2. offer this as a learning experience by publically sharing my ideas and documented src code
3. create a super-simple C-like programming language as a good starting step for LL programming
4. (learn to use VIm)
### Mission
I aim to develop a programming language for beginners to learn basic programming concepts & conventions.\
\
MinC has very limited set of features and consistent syntax for the leaner to keep focused on *a) learning new techniques* and *b) practicing learned techniques* without getting distracted on calling external libaries (such as in Java/Python) or unituitive semantics (C++). It performs extremely well as it is a compiled language (unlike JS or Java) and since it is a 'daugther language' of C, it can perform the same tasks as C can. Find out more: [Learning/Teaching Guide](#learning-guide).\
\
In this repository is a basic compiler which compiles my variant of C (called MinimalistiC or MinC)
into x86 assembly as a *.s* file in the most simple way so others can learn from the source code.

## MinimalistiC Programming Language
MinimalistiC (MinC) is my take on a ultra-simplified, ultra-lightweight, derated version of the C Programming language.
### Aims
MinC's aims to be...
* **minimal**, very easy to teach/learn as it lacks niches and only offers essential programming concepts
* **consistent**, pragmatic use of syntax to easily understand & adapt
* **forward compatible** with C - it can be (almost) be treated as C code and be compiled & optimised with GCC/[TCC](https://bellard.org/tcc/)
* **lightweight**, requires a smaller library and compiler than C/C++, faster compilation, smaller memory footprint
* **lower-level**, more finely controlled optimisations such as memory management without relying on an assembler
* **Most importantly, it aims to keep learners focused on *a) learning new techniques* and *b) practicing learned techniques***

### All Features
1. preprocessor directives (`#include`, `#define`, `#ifdef`, `#endif`)
2. preprocessor macros (`__FILE__`, `__LINE___`, `__TIME__`, `__ASM`, etc.)
3. comments (`//`, `/*`, `*/`)
4. data types (`byte`, `int`)
5. static declarations (`static`) 
6. pointers (`*`, `&`)
7. *very* limited use of arrays (a lÃ¡ ptr math, declare with `[`, `]`)
8. string literals (`"`) to char arrays
9. code structures & scope (`{`, `}`, `.`)
10. basic data structures (`struct`, `union`, `.`, `,`, `;`)
11. functions (`return`)
12. conditionals (`if`)
13. control flow (`while` loops)
14. arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with (`(`, `)`) (with bidmas)
15. binary logic (`!`, `&&`, `||`)
16. equality testing (`==`, `!=`, `>`)
17. linked with the C standard library for portability

That's all. 8 keywords, 4 preprocessor directives,\
and a charset of `a..z`, `0..9` with 20 symbols `. , ; + - * / = # ! & | " > ( ) [ ] { }`\

## MinimalistiC Compiler
MinC Compiler `mcc` compiles MinC to 32-bit x86 assembly *.s* files.
### Summary
1. reads input char by char, being lexed into tokens
   * `file.c` and `io.c` take in the source code as a stream
   * `pp.c` for preprocesses input char stream.
   * `lex.c` tokenise into one of `NULL`, `LITERAL`, `IDENTIFIER`, `KEYWORD`, `SEPARATOR`, `OPERATOR`, or `END OF FILE`
   * `pp.c` parses preprocessor directives `#` and macros
   * if `-E` flag, `dump.c` prints preprocessed code
2. parses token stream in `parse.c` (handwritten parser!) into an Abstract Syntax Tree
   * `parse.c` parses tokens into abstract instructions
   * parser is a top-down recursive decent parser, a *headache* to write
   * parser is hand-written by me specifically for MinC as opposed to FLEX/YACC
   * if `-fd` flag, `dump.c` pretty-prints the AST in readable form
3. generate an Intermediate Representation based on that AST
   * `gen_ir.c` generates linear IR with infinite registers from AST
   * `gen_ir.c` preforms a postal-order traversal of the AST
   * SSA or DAG optimisation is not used, to keep it simple 
   * `memalloc.c` manipulates memory on stack from infinite registers
   * `gen_x86.c` formats linear IR as actual x86 32-bit code in AT&T formatting
   * if `-S` flag, `dump.c` outputs the human-readble IR as an `.s`
5. assembly and linking are done externally
   * GNU's assembler (`as`) converts the human-readable x86 `.s` to `.o` files
   * if `-c` flag, `dump.c` outputs the object file as an `.o`
   * GNU's linker (`ld`) links all `.o` files together and with the C standard library
   * code is linked with the C standard library for portability across OSes
   
### Notes
   * MCC is so small it can fit into a 1980s floppy disk (>160KB)
   * parser rearranges binary expressions to respect precedence such as BIDMAS (insanely confusing to write)
   * generator is non-optimising to keep it simple and easy to understand
   * mingw is 32-bit normally, so asm is also 32 bits
   * memalloc pushes and pops the stack instead of allocating r10-16 as GAS doesn't support it
   * compiler memory management is absent (declares variables on heap but never frees it) 
   * semantic analysis is non-existent therefore allowing implicit type casting (odd quirk)
   * error-checking is minimal too, so errors may be uncaught
   
## Usage Guide
**The compiler can compile MinC files `.mc` as**\
MinC preprocessed files `.mi`\
MinC ast `.md`,\
GAS assembly `.s`,\
object files `.o`,\
**or executables `.exe`.**\
\
Feed it the source code file and arguments to control its output, it will output a text file.\
\
To compile verbosely into x86 (Powershell):

## Learning Guide
### Mission
[Mission written here](#about) and [here](#minimalistic-programming-language).\
It keep learners\
a) focused on learning new techniques\
b) practicising learned techniques to get familiarised using them
### Why to Learn MinC
MinimalisitiC is a programming language meant for begginers which tries to be as simple as possible whilst remaining faithful to the C programming language. Unlike other langauges where they strive for efficiency or implementing abstract concepts, MinC is designed for beginners to keep learners focused on acquiring basic coding paradigms and prevent them from overwhelming themselves with niche or difficult concepts which could discourage them. There are many ways someone could teach a student how to learn Java or JS or C++ since there are many ways to solve a problem, however some techniques of teaching are better than others and bad techniques can lead the student to be overwhelmed by information, and forget the essentials of programming a language, discouraging them or boring them. MinC limits the ways which problems can be solved by distilling a language to its pure essentials, similar to what Scratch does - which it takes inspiration from; this allows the user to self-teach or discover by themselves because of MinC's very small featureset elimnating the need of remembering loads of symbols or external library commands.\
\
It is as powerful as C, since it derives from C and borrows it standard library. Because of its forward-compatibility with C (it can be treated more or less as C code with minor adjustments), it can be compiled on large compilers to ensure it is optimised and linked with existing C libaries such as cURL or libPNG. C is a goto language for low-level software developers and used for mission critical applications, such as in [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories](http://pixelscommander.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/P10.pdf) to develop spacecraft - since MinC can compile as C and theoretically do what C can, it can do just as much.
### Fundementals
MinC heavily simplifes C, and therefore limits learners to use the most basic concepts of programming,
1. **data storage,** variables, datatypes, how data is represented and stored
2. **arithmetic,** performing unary and binary operations
3. **control flow,** conditionals and looping and controlling code
4. **abstraction,** functions, structs, unions, how code is simplifed (basic OOP)\
\
This aids the learning of types whilst limiting the varitions of these concepts, for example,
* There are only 2 data types in MinC, opposed to 12 in C (including unsigned and combinations)
* Only `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as unary operators
* Limited equality checking, only `>` exists, `<` doesn't - `!=` doesn't exist either.
and many more.

## Example
This code demonstrates all features of MinC, excluding preprocessor directives\
**helloWorld.mc**
```
#include "standard.h"

int a; // external declaration
int func_a (byte a); // function declaration

// main function definition
int main ()
{
    int b; // declaration
    b = 0; // assignment
    static byte c = 1 + b; // static, byte type & unary arithmetic, casting
    byte *d = &c; // indirection
    byte e[3]; // array declaration
    e[0] = *d; // array assignment
    byte f[6] = "hello"; // assignment of string literals
    byte g = func_a(c); // assignment from function call
    // conditionals and equality testing
    if (g == 0 && e[0] == 1)
    {
        g = 2 >> 1; // bitwise operations
    }
    // while loop
    while (g > 0)
    {
        g = g - 2 + 1; // binary precedence with BIDMAS
    }
    printf("%s world %d\n", f, g); // standard library call
    return 0; // return
}
// struct definition
struct struct_a 
{
    // union definition
    union
    {
        int val_a = 0; // static assignment
        byte val_b;
    };
};
int func_a (byte a)
{
    struct_a s; // struct declaration
    s.val_a = 0; // struct member assignment
    s.val_b = a; // union member overwrite
    return s.val_b;
}
```
Powershell:
```
./mcc -o helloWorld helloWorld.mc ; ./helloWorld
hello world 0
```
## Devlog
**Development started 27.08.19 and over 75 manhours across 5 months were dedicated for this project**\
**All commits and changes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Chai112/MinC-Compiler/commits/master)**\
Devlog contains all documentation to show my progress of learning and developing a compiler and language - hopefully this will show problems which I faced and how I overcame them as a good reference for anyone who starts a project similar (or not) to this.
### Research & Inspirations
Inspired by [Nora Sandler's](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html), [Rui Ueyama's](https://www.sigbus.info/how-i-wrote-a-self-hosting-c-compiler-in-40-days) and [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/) article to make a C compiler, I started to write a compiler. I didn't really want to write a C compiler though, I could just copy code from the hundreds of repositories there are online, so I decided to write my own language where all my ideas could be original and not a replication of others. It was initially named BitC and was drastically different to C. It would be cool though if I wrote a MinC compiler which compiled itself so I could see how inefficient it got over the iterations of self-compilation.\
\
By this point, I was very familiar with C++ from my [OpenGL ESC engine](https://github.com/Chai112/ESC) and Facial Identification [AIFRED](https://github.com/Chai112/AIFRED) projects but relatively unaware of how featureless C was compared to C++.
I chose to write my compiler in C, seeing that it was a popular choice for most compiler development examples online, and knew that C/C++ dealt very closely with lower-level aspects such as controlling memory allocation on both the stack and heap memory and lacked complicated library callings (`printf` instead of `System.out.println`). C, as a compiled language unlike Java or JS, runs more efficiently and therefore faster - so if I were to write the compiler in C, compile-times of MinC projects will be relatively short - this only matters in large projects and I'm not very sure why someone would write large projects in MinC. 
### Week 1 - Initial Development
Basically, a compiler is a text converter. It is fed text as input (for example, a `.c` file) and outputs text as a `.s` assembly or an `.exe` executable. I am familiar with GNU's Compiler Collection (GCC) - it runs on terminal or command prompt or whatever text-based shell - sans GUI - so MinC will be done pretty much the same way. A compiler doesn't require dealing with fancy I/O, rendering or any other external libraries or APIs or SDKs - it is a very clean and lightweight project and saves time on learning APIs and debugging them. For example, I had experienced horrible memory leaking with [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) when implementing texture loading for my OpenGL renderer which tooks days to debug.\
\
Day one was configuring the only I/O I needed, which was to read a file and write one, and begin writing a preprocessor for my C code.

## Install
The compiler generates x86 32-bit assembly code for Intel CPUs.
\
Should work for 32-bit Unix-like OSes and 32-bit Windows. \
Tested on Windows 10 and Mac OS X Mojave. \
Will not work on Catalina as it has no legacy support for 32-bit applications.\
\
[MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/) is required for assembly and linking.\
Uses GNU's assembler (GAS) and linker.
Links with C Standard library for portability across all OSes.
\
Please download the repository and cd into it using command prompt or terminal.\
Make sure [GNU Make is installed](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), do
```
make all
```
The source code will be compiled by GNU Make into an executable, mcc in the bin file.\
Compilation tests will be perfomed automatically after successful compilation by Make.\
\
Run the executable with -h flag for instructions. *(Unix terminal)*
```
cd bin ; ./mcc -h
```
or give it a MinC file, dump parser's AST `-fd` and verbosely compile `-v` into executable
```
./mcc -fd -v test/file.mc
```
